\newpage

\section{Executive Summary}
% 3-4 sentence overview: What is this paper about? Why does it matter?

\section{Problem Statement}
% What specific problem does this paper address?
% Why is this problem important?
% What are the limitations of existing approaches?

\section{Methods Overview}
% List the primary techniques/architectures used

\section{Architecture Diagram Description}
% IMPORTANT: Provide a detailed textual description of the system architecture
% This description will be used to generate a visual diagram
% Format:
% Components: [List all major components]
% Data Flow: [Describe how data flows through the system step-by-step]
% Key Interactions: [Describe how components interact]

\section{Detailed Methodology}

\subsection{Prerequisites}
\begin{prerequisite}
% Specific concepts needed (NOT vague like "linear algebra")
% Prior work/papers that should be understood first
\end{prerequisite}

\subsection{Architecture and Approach}
% Break down the methodology step-by-step
% Explain mathematical formulations clearly
% Use analogies where helpful
% Define all notation explicitly

\subsection{Implementation Details}
% Key algorithmic steps
% Design choices and rationale

\section{The Breakthrough}
\begin{keyinsight}
% What is the breakthrough/novel contribution?
% Why is this approach better/different?
% What makes this work significant?
\end{keyinsight}

\section{Conclusion}
% Key takeaways for students
% Impact on the field
% Practical applications and implications

\end{document}

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Write for CS students, not experts
- Explain technical terms when first introduced
- Be detailed but clear - focus on conceptual understanding
- Use examples and analogies where helpful
- Maintain technical accuracy while being accessible
- Output ONLY the complete LaTeX document, nothing else
- Do NOT include markdown code blocks or any other formatting
- Start directly with \documentclass

CONTENT FOCUS:
✅ INCLUDE:
- Problem statement and motivation
- Architecture and methodology (conceptual explanation)
- Novel contributions and breakthrough ideas
- How the system works (step-by-step)
- Prerequisites and background knowledge
- Practical implications

❌ EXCLUDE (DO NOT INCLUDE):
- Benchmark results and evaluation metrics
- Performance comparisons with other methods
- Experimental setup details
- Dataset statistics and numbers
- Quantitative results and tables
- Ablation studies
- Any sections titled "Experimental Setup", "Results", "Evaluation", or "Experiments"

The goal is conceptual understanding, NOT empirical validation.

LATEX SYNTAX RULES (CRITICAL):
- ALWAYS use proper LaTeX command syntax with braces: \textit{word} NOT \textitword
- ALWAYS use proper LaTeX command syntax: \textbf{word} NOT \textbfword
- Use LaTeX math symbols inside $ or \[ \]: NOT Unicode symbols
- Escape special characters: \_ for underscore, \% for percent, \$ for dollar
- Use \times for multiplication, \in for element-of, NOT × or ∈
- Test every command has proper braces: \command{content}
- Math mode: Use $x \in R$ NOT $x ∈ R$

// SyntaxValidationPrompt is used for focused syntax-only validation
const SyntaxValidationPrompt = `You are a LaTeX syntax expert. Your ONLY job is to check for and fix syntax errors.

Check this LaTeX document for ALL syntax errors:
- Unclosed braces { }
- Unclosed environments (\begin{} without \end{})
- Invalid command syntax (e.g., \textbf{word text -> \textbf{word} text)
- Unescaped special characters
- Missing $ for math mode
- Any compilation errors

CRITICAL: If you find ANY errors, output the COMPLETE CORRECTED LaTeX document.
If there are NO errors, output exactly: VALID
